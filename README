Why hello there reader.

I prefer looking at things in a web browser so I hooked incanter charts into a web server. It's interactive so any change to the files will be reflected immediately with a page refresh.

Steps (I may be missing something towards the beginning. Adapt and document as necessary.):
1. Install lein (http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen)
2. /ml$ lein repl
3. Get a cup of tea while it fetches deps and builds stuff
4. ml.core=> (serve)
5. Go to http://localhost:8080 in a browser to view pretty charts
6. Leave that shell open (it will show debug output) and then start developing in your IDE

To Do:
- Add routes for each chart instead of always showing the normal dist
- Add machines for learning
